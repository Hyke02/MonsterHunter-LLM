The tail is lighter and more\nresembles a Long Sword, and because of this, it is able to\nattack quicker and use more gracile moves reminiscent of its\nweapon counterpart. When the tail dulls it will grow an acidic\ncompound that covers the entirety of its tail. This acid will\nlower the toughness of whatever it is fighting, and can be\nthrown off at opponents during some of its attacks.\nWhile the common Glavenus inhabits forests, deserts, and\nvolcanos, Acidic Glavenus inhabits the more extreme Rotten\nVale and the Rotten region of the Guiding Lands.

Older ceadeus\nindividuals are called goldbeard ceadeus. Ceadeus has a\nspecial relationship with an algae, which is the reason why it\nhas its beard. Using its beard, the ceadus collects the algae\nand uses the glow from the luminous bacteria as a form of\nphotosynthesis.\nWith this algae, ceadeus can spend longer times under the\ndepths without having to come up for air. When it needs air, it\nwill swim up with a burst of speed and jump out of the water\nfor a breath. It is estimated a ceadeus can hold its breath for\nabout several months.

Its\nbody structure is reminiscent of Fatalis, with relatively short\nlimbs and a long tail and neck. Its body is filled with a\nmagma-like substance which pools at the base of the tail, the\nchest, and at each shoulder. Each of these pools directs\nmagma flow to certain parts of the body. On its back are a\npair of wing-like appendages. Seemingly useless in terms of\nflight, these \"wings\" feature cannon-like chutes which can\nextrude globules of magma, both as a means of defense and\nas a way to jettison excess magma. Dire Miralis head features\na frill-like structure and an upturned snout.\nDue to the hot fluids inside of Dire Miralis, an intense heat\nis known to come from its body, boiling any sources of water\naround it. This intense heat can easily wipe out all living\ncreatures within Dire Miralis's range.\nInterestingly, long after a Dire Miralis dies, its heart\ncontinues to beat even if removed--just as legend states. It is\nsaid that Dire Miralis can regenerate its whole body with its\nheart alone, and that Dire Miralis is even immortal.\nDire Miralis is extremely hostile to all living things and can\ndestroy an entire ecosystem just from its intense heat.

However, even if this horn is\ndestroyed, Kirin can still summon lightning bolts with little\neffort.\nSome of the more rare, older, or just stronger individuals\nare known for having unusually strong electrical powers that\nare yet to be fully understood. Some of the larger, more\nstronger muscles are located in its legs, capable of delivering\ndeadly kicks.

Its face bears two\nlarge, forward-facing eyes, and crests around its head make\nthe shape of a crown. The distinct arms are well-muscled, and\nthe fingers are shown to be spindly and misshapen, bearing\nspecialized tips for sound production. Spikes, markings,\nplates and indentations run along its neck, back, sides, and\nlimbs, some invoking skeletal structures such as a ribcage.\nThe tail ends in a entwining series of snaking structures,\nfailing to form any one tip.\nShara Ishvalda can manipulate the earth using its innate\nability to control vibration.

Its face has long, sinewy features that\nlook like decaying tissue. When it flaps its wings, it appears\nto stir up toxic clouds, possibly exuding the Effluvium\nbacteria found in the Rotten Vale. It is shown to have a\nmottled maroon hide with a rather dull greenish-gray\nunderbelly. Its wings are also sinewy — looking like spider\nwebs when outstretched.\nVaal Hazak appears to consume the life force of other\nwildlife nearby in the form of a grayish ash-like fog that trails\nfrom the victim back to patches on Vaal Hazak’s body. It has\nalso demonstrated necromancer-like abilities, bringing Girros\ncorpses back to life as allies.

The most prominent trait, which gives the\nmales their title, are wind sacs which Ibushi use to float\naround. These wind sacs are located on the forelegs, back,\nchest, and tail tips, marked by the presence of glowing\ntendrils on Ibushi's body. The wind sacs are capable of\ninflating to a degree and produce a special gas that Ibushi\ncan freely control, which is then primarily used for it's own\npropulsion.\nNot much is known about Ibushi prior to its discovery.\nHowever, what is known is that Ibushi wanders around in the\nsky in search of its \"queen\", as referred to by Hinoa during\ntheir resonation.

The zorah\nmagdaros’s diet consists of minerals containing explosive\nmaterials, which it absorbs and processes into energy,\ncontributing to its fiery nature. Despite its immense size and\ndestructive potential, it is relatively docile and tends to ignore\nmost threats, although it will retaliate with massive physical\nblows if sufficiently provoked.\nThis elder dragon is capable of causing significant\ngeological changes simply by moving through an area. Its\nbody constantly spews magma from crater-like vents, which it\ncan weaponize into devastating attacks. Researchers propose\nthat what are perceived as normal volcanoes might be\ndormant zorah magdaros, explaining the rarity of sightings.\nDespite its gentle nature, the zorah magdaros will fiercely\ndefend itself if necessary, using its immense strength to crush\nany perceived threats.\nThe zorah magdaros’s presence has a profound ecological\nimpact, often reshaping landscapes and creating\nopportunities for other monsters to inhabit newly formed\nenvironments.

The spikes on its body\nmostly lie flat, but when it has built up an electric charge they\nstick out vertically into the air.\nThe Zinogre can also harness the power of electricity,\nmuch like a lagiacrus, using it to take down larger prey and to\ndefend itself and its territory. Thunderbugs are seen\ngathering around zinogre when it is \"charging\" electricity;\nthey may act as a source of energy. As Zinogre preys on\nGargwa, Thunderbugs become safe, simply by flying around\nin close proximity to a Zinogre. Zinogre can exploit this by\nabsorbing the energy emitted by the bugs during battle,\ngranting it special abilities.

The monster occasionally enters a\n\"superheated\" state, causing the gaps between its scales to\nglow red hot.\nThe Bazelgeuse's most distinctive trait is its ability to shed\nexplosive scales.

This may also have contributed to\nthem not being discovered until recently.\nAnother adaptation that separates this nargacuga from its\nrelatives are its tail spikes, which contain a powerful toxin\ncapable of making a rathalos woozy and killing a hunter in a\nmatter of moments. Interestingly, the wyverns appear to\nproduce these toxins in their tail but how is a mystery. The\njaws of the Lucent Nargacuga are the strongest of the three\nnargacuga species and are capable of biting through the\ntoughest of armors. Its razors (the blades on its arms) are as\nwell much tougher and, unsurprisingly sharper than its\ncounterparts.\nLucent nargacuga are territorial and highly aggressive\ntowards both rival predators and hunters. Their toxic tail\nspikes and invisibility during the night make these creatures\ndeadly opponents and should not be underestimated by even\nexperienced hunters.\nDexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) piercing\ndamage plus 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed","metadata":{"source":"./documents/Monster-Hunter-Monster-Manual.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Monster Hunter Monster Manual | GM Binder","Creator":"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/127.0.0.0 Safari/537.36","Producer":"GPL Ghostscript 10.03.1","CreationDate":"D:20240813101257-05'00'","ModDate":"D:20240813101257-05'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:modifydate":"2024-08-13T10:12:57-05:00","xmp:createdate":"2024-08-13T10:12:57-05:00","xmp:creatortool":"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/127.0.0.0 Safari/537.36","dc:title":"Monster Hunter Monster Manual | GM Binder"}},"totalPages":450},"loc":{"pageNumber":296,"lines":{"from":1,"to":27}}}}],["2da5f2da-e6bf-42af-94b1-32c1b08a64f4",{"pageContent":"deadly opponents and should not be underestimated by even\nexperienced hunters.\nDexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) piercing\ndamage plus 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed\nsave, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nBonus ActionsBonus Actions\nShadow Stealth.

The top of its head is tipped\nwith a pair of horn-like ears, and its segmented tail ends with\na spiny protrusion.\nAs a quadrupedal wyvern, its wings have evolved into\nforelegs, which allows it to run at very fast speeds. Though it\npossesses a pair of adequately-developed wings, it is rarely\nseen flying in a traditional sense. It is in fact more prone to\ngliding from location to location. It has a powerful set of\nlungs which gives it the ability to produce extremely loud,\nconcussive roars which can physically damage nearby\nobjects. The tigrex relies on its sheer brute strength to bring\ndown opponents.\nWhen idle, the tigrex will assume a bipedal gait, standing\nonly upon its hind legs while holding its forelimbs at its side.\nWhen threatened or engaging prey, however, it will stand\nupon all fours and ready itself for combat. It will usually\nattempt to intimidate would-be attackers with an ear-splitting\nroar.\nThe Tigrex can be found in many different environments.\nLike many wyverns, it will travel far and wide in search of\nprey.\nYoung SeregiosYoung Seregios\nChallenge Rating 2                                            Carves 1\nCarve ChanceMaterialSlots\n1-8Seregios Blunt Scale(A,W)\n9-15Seregios Talon(A,W)\n16-20Y.Seregios Scraper(A,W)\nARMOR MATERIAL EFFECTS\nSeregios Blunt Scale","metadata":{"source":"./documents/Monster-Hunter-Monster-Manual.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Monster Hunter Monster Manual | GM Binder","Creator":"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/127.0.0.0 Safari/537.36","Producer":"GPL Ghostscript 10.03.1","CreationDate":"D:20240813101257-05'00'","ModDate":"D:20240813101257-05'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:modifydate":"2024-08-13T10:12:57-05:00","xmp:createdate":"2024-08-13T10:12:57-05:00","xmp:creatortool":"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/127.0.0.0 Safari/537.36","dc:title":"Monster Hunter Monster Manual | GM Binder"}},"totalPages":450},"loc":{"pageNumber":310,"lines":{"from":1,"to":32}}}}],["35600cef-f23e-40f9-9ac2-fb1d7faffe0a",{"pageContent":"Carve ChanceMaterialSlots\n1-8Seregios Blunt Scale(A,W)\n9-15Seregios Talon(A,W)\n16-20Y.Seregios Scraper(A,W)\nARMOR MATERIAL EFFECTS\nSeregios Blunt Scale\nYou reduce slashing damage you take by 3 while you wear\nthis armor.\nSeregios Talon\nGourmand.

They are almost always more adept at\nfighting underwater, while most adventurers are hindered by the liquids.

The shell\nforms two ridges on its neck reminiscent of Lagiacrus's hood.\nFour more of these ridges adorn the body, running right to\nthe tip of its tail. Almudron has scaly skin ranging in color\nfrom gray to creamy yellow to pinkish red. Its underbelly is\ncovered in wide, pinkish scales.

A large water monster It sits comfortably at the\ntop of the oceanic food chain. It is the top predator of its\nhabitat, and even predators such as Rathalos and Rathian\nprefer to keep out of its way. Of course being the Lagiacrus'\nonly real competition besides each other, the Fire Wyverns\nwould be considered a threat to a Lagiacrus, as would a\nLagiacrus to a Fire Wyvern. Lagiacrus's control of Thunder\nElement makes it a dangerous adversary in the aquatic\nhabitat it resides, even for the well defended Gobul. Even\nPlesioth that migrate to tropical islands and flooded forests\nwould be wary of the large and powerful leviathan as its\npowerful electrical attacks can easily cripple or even kill the\nPiscine Wyvern. This would cause Plesioth to avoid\nLagiacrus at all costs. Lagiacrus are known to feed on fish,\nlobsters, Kelbi, Aptonoth, and Epioth.\nLagiacrus are highly aggressive Leviathans that are the\n\"Lord of the Sea\". To hunt down and capture prey, Lagiacrus\nwill swim in a circle to form a whirlpool.

Males and females will gather together in\nthe swamps to spawn, but only a handful of their eggs will\nhatch. By the time the wet season is over, most of the water\nwill have evaporated in the swamp, drying out the eggs. Once\nthe young hatch, they'll search for a large monster and enter\ninto the body of the organism by swimming into an opening\n(Wound, nostrils, mouth, etc.) before attaching their spine-like\ngills to its insides. The young jyuratodus will sneak into the\nbodies of larger creatures and feed on their insides until they\nget older.\nGajauGajau\nSmall wyvern (piscine), unaligned\nArmor Class 11\nHit Points 27 (6d6 + 6)\nSpeed 0 ft., swim 30 ft.\nSTRDEXCONINTWISCHA\n14 (+2)13 (+1)12 (+1)1 (-5)10 (+0)8 (-1)\nSenses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10\nLanguages —\nChallenge 1 (200 XP)                                 Proficiency +2\nBlood Frenzy.

Well for the sake of it all until I get around to\nmaking proper sidekick classes for palamutes and\npalicos.
